# Mechovate Project README

## Color System

### Palette
- **Primary**: #0d3b3b (Dark Teal)
- **Secondary**: #2a5298 (Blue)
- **Accent**: #f7f9fb (Light Gray)
- **Text**: #f5eeee (Off White)
- **Background**: rgba(13, 59, 59, 0.55)

### Rationale
The palette conveys stability, innovation, and readability, with a modern aesthetic.

## Breakpoint Logic
- **SM (Mobile)**: Up to 480px
  - Hamburger menu; full-width cards.
  
- **MD (Tablet)**: 481px to 768px
  - 2-column layout; visible navigation.

- **LG (Desktop)**: 769px and above
  - Multi-column layout; larger text.

## Creative Divergence
- Added a hamburger menu for mobile.
- Made cards responsive.
- Adjusted typography for readability.
- Used a semi-transparent background.
- Refined button styles for interaction.

These changes enhance usability while maintaining the design vision.
